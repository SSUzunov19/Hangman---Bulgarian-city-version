# Hangman-Bulgarian-city-version
This is a classic "Hangman" game developed in Python and tkinter, featuring words related to Bulgarian cities. The game is a fun way to improve your vocabulary while having a good time.

# How to play
The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of the "hangman" is drawn. The game ends when either the player correctly guesses the word, or the "hangman" is completed.
